COIS Page:
  - How to tell if COI was processed by target?
  - maybe column for if there is an expired policy (maybe check / X)

Audits Page:
  - score
  - validity date
  - meta, list of how many sharing jobs have run on it # of keys in that object. "Shares"
  - Maybe change shares in modal to a searchable table.

Add page for `fsqa-certificates`

Add page for `letters-of-guarantee`

- Make share list a table if lots of them
- Make lists disappear if no items in sidebar
  - OR if link 404's, watch upper level.
